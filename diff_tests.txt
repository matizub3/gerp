Purpose: This file documents all diff tests that were performed to ensure
         identical functionality between our implementation of Gerp and the
         reference program the_gerp. All diff tests were motivated by all 
         considered edge and general testing cases expressed in the README file.



----- denotes the seperation of all diff tests. Please note that the following 
input was separately inputted into the program using individual test input files
through cin after compiling and running the executable ./gerp for our 
implementation. Every single diff testing was considered using the tinyData, 
smallGutenberg, mediumGutenberg, and largeGutenberg directories.
